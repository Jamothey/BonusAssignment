# compare sorting algorithms

Major Things changed in the code:
- The printArray function now prints data sizes that are less than 200 numbers
- The main function take in input from the user to determine which file they would like to run in order to compare the algorithms
- input file 1 (input1.txt) from lab 8 was added into the code as input4.txt; this file is used to test the logic of the sorting algorithms, there is no real difference shown in the runtime for this file specifically
- Alloc and DeAlloc have the "print data allocated/deallocated" functions commented out so that the user can actually see the comparison of the different sorting algorithms. Before these were taking out the terminal window was spammed with them and the user could not see all of the different algorithms becaus the terminal window would remove them after a certain point.
